# Black_Friday_Sale_Prediction
Black Friday is a major shopping event where retailers offer large discounts, leading to a significant increase in customer purchases. The goal of this project is to predict how much a customer will spend during Black Friday based on various factors such as demographics, product categories, and past purchases. Using machine learning models, the project aims to forecast customer spending patterns to help retailers make informed decisions.
The project used three machine learning models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor. Linear Regression provided a baseline by modeling simple linear relationships. The Decision Tree Regressor captured non-linear patterns by splitting data based on conditions. Random Forest Regressor, the best-performing model, used ensemble learning to combine multiple decision trees, reducing overfitting and improving accuracy by averaging predictions, making it ideal for large, complex datasets.

Flow of the Code:
•	Data loading, exploration, and handling missing values.
•	Preprocessing: Label encoding and scaling features.
•	Visualizations to analyze trends.
•	Model training: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
•	Predictions saved in a CSV file.

Real-Time Applications:
	Personalized marketing for targeting specific customers.
	Maximizing revenue by identifying high-value customers.
	Recommending products based on customer preferences.
